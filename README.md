# Twitter-Kafka

This Twitter feed is used to get real time data streams into an application that will put data into an Kafka.

This data will end up in ElasticSearch at the end and this is just for POC purposes. 

No commercial application will result out of this and I won't have any users besides just myself.

Twitter data will not be displayed, and we will only extract tweets on low volume.
